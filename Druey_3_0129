A class constructor is a thing that lets you create new classes.

Animation, hitbox and hit points should be included in this class because the orbs are going to be an entity that acts as if it were a weapon.

The methods that the orb should have is moving, taking away the player and enemies health, and most likely homing... or "following" the player.
