To complete my game, I could have added an enemy, blocked walls all the way,
 unblock certain walls because some of them didn't allow you to go certain places,
 make the camera work for the size of my map, not the size of Unwaverings map.


I figured out how to solve certain problems by looking at the code and tinkering with it.
