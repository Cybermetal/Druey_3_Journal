Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);

This code sets up the animation for the Player.

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?

Skills we're trying to practice are to tinker, be awesome, and solve problems.

How do you make an arraylist?

public ArrayList<Orb> orbz = new ArrayList();

In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):
