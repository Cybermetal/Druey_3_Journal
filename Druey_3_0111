What challeneges have you encountered with your slick game?

No challenges yet, I have yet to figure out how to create gravity, but hey! That's just about it.

What slick game will you create? 

I will be creating a 2D platformer. In my honest opinion, it seems much more fun than a dungeon crawler. Since I have the resources to make a platformer, I will create that.

What challenges have you faced/are you facing?

Creating objects and implementing gravity.
